## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file for 'Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)'.
The file is located at `specs/4-vla-module-4/tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the `tasks.md` file.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 1 file created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The process was smooth. The initial script execution failed due to system policy. I was able to recover by manually executing the steps.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Script execution failure due to PowerShell execution policy.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment: none
