# Quickstart: Adding a New Chapter to Module 2

This guide explains how to add a new chapter to Module 2.

1.  **Create a new markdown file:**
    -   Inside the `book/docs/2-digital-twin-module-2/` directory, create a new markdown file (e.g., `4-new-chapter.md`).

2.  **Add content to the chapter:**
    -   Write the content for the chapter in Markdown.

3.  **Update the sidebar:**
    -   If you are using autogenerated sidebars, the new chapter will be added automatically.

4.  **Build and test:**
    -   Run `npm run start` in the `book` directory to start the local development server.
    -   Check that the new chapter appears in the sidebar and that the content is rendered correctly.
