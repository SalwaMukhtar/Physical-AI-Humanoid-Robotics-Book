# Research: Gazebo and Unity Versioning

**Decision:**
-   **ROS 2 Version:** The book will standardize on **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill**, which is the latest long-term support (LTS) version.
-   **Gazebo Version:** The recommended Gazebo version for ROS 2 Humble is **Gazebo Fortress**. The book will use this version for all simulations.
-   **Unity Version:** The book will recommend **Unity 2021.1.7f1** or a newer version. This is a tested and stable version for ROS 2 integration.

**Rationale:**
-   Using the latest LTS version of ROS 2 ensures long-term support and stability.
-   Gazebo Fortress is the officially supported Gazebo version for ROS 2 Humble, which will minimize compatibility issues.
-   Unity 2021.1.7f1 is a known working version for ROS 2 integration, providing a reliable starting point for readers.

**Alternatives considered:**
-   Using a newer, non-LTS version of ROS 2 was considered, but this could lead to a less stable experience for readers.
-   Using other versions of Gazebo or Unity was considered, but this would increase the risk of compatibility problems.
